I'm Alex, also known as Tonic in some online spaces, and this is my blog.

There's not going to be any one consistent topic focused in on on this site - I tend to write infrequently and what I'm working on is always changing - but I love Hi-Fi Music, Vinyl Collecting, Retro Computing, Film Photography; I read a lot, eat a lot, and like to build things, so if you like anything on that list, I'm sure you'll find something that interests you here.

## Other Spaces

I maintain this blog because I love eclectic, personal spaces on the internet, and wanted to contribute to that in my own way.

Here are some other cool spaces on the internet I recommend:

* [Tom Francis' Blog](https://pentadact.com) (Game Designer)
* [Rekka's Site](https://kokorobot.ca/), [Devine's Site](https://xxiivv.com/) & [100 Rabbits](https://100r.co/site/home.html) (Artists & Designers)
* [Umami](https://www.youtube.com/c/umamianimations) & [Hexsystem](https://www.hexsystem.com/) (Animator & Musician) (Same Person)
* [The Minute Hour](https://theminutehour.com/) (Sound Artist)
* [Drue Langlois](https://www.youtube.com/user/siolgnaleurd) (Animator)

I also run the [Lucky Cat Chat](https://luckycat.chat), which is a Federated Social Network . If you're looking to join the Fediverse, or are tired of the node you're on, I invite you to join me! I'm a pretty casual admin.

I'm on a smattering of other social networks, but the Lucky Cat is the main one.

## How this Blog Works

This blog is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator written in Go; special thanks to [Athul](https://github.com/athul), who wrote the [Archie](https://github.com/athul/archie) theme, which is the bones of this blogs design. The site is pushed to Github and built automagically with [Fleek](https://fleek.co/), which in turn deploys it on the [Interplanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/); meaning this site is powered by the distributed web!

~~Comments are served by [Commento](https://commento.io/), which may be subject to change in the future.~~

~~Posts are written using [Forestry](https://forestry.io "Forestry"), which may be subject to change in the future.~~

The [Applause Button](https://applause-button.com/) is built by [Colin Eberhardt](https://github.com/ColinEberhardt/).
