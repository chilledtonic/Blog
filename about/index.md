I'm Alex, also known as Tonic in some online spaces, and this is my blog.

There's not going to be any one consistent topic focused in on on this site - I tend to write infrequently and what I'm working on is always changing - but I love Hi-Fi Music, Vinyl Collecting, Retro Computing, Film Photography; I read a lot, eat a lot, and like to build things, so if you like anything on that list, I'm sure you'll find something that interests you here.

## Other Spaces

I maintain this blog because I love eclectic, personal spaces on the internet, and wanted to contribute to that in my own way.

Here are some other cool spaces on the internet I recommend:

* [Tom Francis' Blog](https://pentadact.com) (Game Designer)
* [Rekka's Site](https://kokorobot.ca/), [Devine's Site](https://xxiivv.com/) & [100 Rabbits](https://100r.co/site/home.html) (Artists & Designers)
* [Umami](https://www.youtube.com/c/umamianimations) & [Hexsystem](https://www.hexsystem.com/) (Animator & Musician) (Same Person)
* [The Minute Hour](https://theminutehour.com/) (Sound Artist)
* [Drue Langlois](https://www.youtube.com/user/siolgnaleurd) (Animator)

I also run the [Lucky Cat Chat](https://luckycat.chat), which is a Federated Social Network . If you're looking to join the Fediverse, or are tired of the node you're on, I invite you to join me! I'm a pretty casual admin.

## How this Blog Works

This blog is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator written in Go; special thanks to [Athul](https://github.com/athul), who wrote the [Archie](https://github.com/athul/archie) theme, which is the bones of this blogs design.

The site is built automatically using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard). It works fine. Someday I'd like it to run off of [https://srht.site](Source Hut), and add Gemini support.

## Other FAQ's

1. Why does your blog use both the Gregorian Calendar and the French Republican Calendar?

Because the French Republican Calendar is sick, no further questions

2. Why the name "Canned Fish"

The domain came to me in a dream.
