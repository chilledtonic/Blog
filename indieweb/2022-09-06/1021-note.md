title: Abuse Emails & 554 Errors
---
If your abuse email returns a 554 error for "untrusted domains", there's a special place in hacker hell for you.

your client is trustworthy enough to rent a budget VPS to spam people with, but I'm not trustworthy enough to report that abuse to you? 

Make it make sense.
