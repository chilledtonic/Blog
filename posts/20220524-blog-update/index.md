I stopped updating this blog after two posts for a couple reasons:

1. I enjoyed setting up the website more then I did writing for it - I created the perfect blog in terms of _reading_ it (personally, you may debate this), but paid no attention to how I was going to write for it, and editing Markdown files is just enough of a PITA that I wanted to avoid doing it (subconciously or otherwise)

2. IPFS stopped playing nice with Hugo, the site generator I prefer, so the website remained a broken link for a period of time. With the lack of enthusiasm I had to fixing that particular issue, the site remaind dormant.

3. Cryptocurrency bullshit. This blog is hosted via IPFS, which is a technology that has been coopted by crypto losers. I briefly played with Ethereum a few years back but beyond the environmental, humanitarian, and ethical problems with crypto, I find it deeply troubling that their is no use for it that's not better served by a SQL table. Fleek, my IPFS pin provider, no longer aligns with my views on crypto - but it's a mild PITA to recreate the CDI pipeline on a different platform, so I didn't bother.

After a busy year with many ongoing, interesting projects, I realized I craved having my own space on the internet again. I shopped around for a couple days for newer, better blogging platforms and found myself looking back at my "perfect" Hugo theme once again.

So, here we are. Here's whats changed.

1. Switched to a [Serif Font](https://github.com/edwardtufte/et-book), for increased readability.

2. Moved away from Fleek as a "hosting" provider.

3. Am currently working on making writing for this blog an easier process. The perfect solution is if I could edit all my posts with an editor like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), or better yet - email them directly to the blog.

The last point is the most interesting problem at the moment. This website is built using as [Static Site Generator](https://hugo.io), which means new blogposts have to be checked in via Git. Previously I tried using [Forestry](forestry.io) as a drop-in CMS, but found it lacking, so I usually wrote posts in VSCode. It worked but it wasn't the nicest solution. I don't know what I'll do for this yet.

Finally, I've started tracking tasks through [Todoist](https://todoist.com). It intergrates well with everything but my E-Reader, and I've started to use it to actually track posts I've been wanting to write, instead of them drifting off into the ether if I don't sit down to write them immediately. Here's to more content in 2022/CCXXX and beyond!
